## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

### Operating System
* Windows (due to dependencies like `pygetwindow`, `win32gui`, `pycaw`, `screen_brightness_control`, `win32com.client`, `psutil`)

### Python Version
* Python 3.8 or higher is recommended.

### Dependencies
You can install all required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Or install them individually:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3 speechRecognition PyAudio fuzzywuzzy python-Levenshtein pygetwindow pycaw comtypes screen_brightness_control opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui pyqt6 psutil google-generativeai pynput Pillow
```

**Note:** Some dependencies like `PyAudio` might require additional system-level libraries (e.g., PortAudio for `PyAudio`). Please refer to their respective documentation for detailed installation instructions if you encounter issues.

### Hardware

  * **Microphone**: For voice commands and voice typing.
  * **Webcam**: For gesture control.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/IGOTYOU.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/IGOTYOU.git)
cd IGOTYOU
```

### 2\. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3\. Google Gemini API Key Setup

**Important**: The `main.py` file contains a placeholder for the Google Gemini API key:
`genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")`

You **must** replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual Google Gemini API key. You can obtain one from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### 4\. GIF for Audio Visualizer (Optional)

The `QtAudioVisualizer.py` file expects a GIF file named `your_gif.gif` in the same directory.
`gif_path = 'your_gif.gif'`
You can replace `'your_gif.gif'` with the path to your desired GIF file, or provide one in the project's root directory.

### 5\. Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

-----

## üí° Usage

Once the application is running, a small, non-intrusive notification will appear at the bottom of your screen, indicating that the voice assistant is listening.

### Voice Commands:

Simply speak your commands. Here are some examples:

  * "Open Chrome"
  * "Start Notepad"
  * "Close active window"
  * "Kill Spotify"
  * "Switch to next window"
  * "Switch to previous window"
  * "Minimize window"
  * "Maximize window"
  * "Increase volume by 0.1"
  * "Decrease brightness by 10"
  * "Set brightness to 50"
  * "Enable voice typing"
  * "Disable voice typing"
  * "What is the capital of France?" (for AI query)

### Voice Typing:

1.  Say "Enable voice typing".
2.  Start speaking. Your speech will be typed into the currently active window.
3.  To stop voice typing, press the `Delete` key on your keyboard or say "Disable voice typing".

### Gesture Control:

Ensure your webcam is active and visible.

  * **Switch Windows:**
      * **Swipe Right:** Move your hand from left to right in front of the camera (simulates `Alt + Tab`).
      * **Swipe Left:** Move your hand from right to left in front of the camera (simulates `Alt + Shift + Tab`).
  * **Cursor Control:**
      * **Index Finger Pointing:** Point your index finger forward. The mouse cursor will follow your finger's movement.
